# BlockchainThreatModeling
This repo contains an initiative of producing a blockchain risk assessment framework by conducting a threat modeling process 
## Blockchain Secuirty Challenges 
Blockchain is a powerful distributed technology that has recently emerged as a key tool in the digitaltransformation of several industries. Its integration in various applications has the potential to revolutionize the way we connect and secure devices, unlock new levels of innovation and efficiency, and create a more sustainable and interconnected world.  However, the widespread adoption of blockchain technology is hindered by several security and privacy issues that are unique to this technology. Unlike traditional security issues, blockchain security
concerns are not easily mitigated. Because the blockchain is immutable, once data has been written to it, it cannot be changed. Moreover, the decentralized nature of the blockchain means that there is no central authority controlling the network, making it challenging to identify and respond to securit threats. Furthermore, the advanced features of blockchain, such as smart contracts, introduce novel types of security risks that are not typically found in traditional systems. As such, it is essential to develop innovative security measures to mitigate these challenges and enable the secure and successful adoption of blockchain technology across various industries.
